## Prompt:

Asking good questions is a valuable skill to have - asking questions in
an online setting is both easier and harder than asking questions in
person: we can prepare to ask a question but we are also expected to
prepare. The links posted here give some advice on how to ask good
questions:

-   stackoverflow’s [Asking a good
    question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)

-   R’s [Posting
    guidelines](https://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html)

-   [minimal complete verifiable
    example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve), [minimal reproducible
    example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/)

Follow these links and read through the advice given, then

1.  **Pick at least one question from stackoverflow or the R help and
    answer it.**

Write a blog post answering the following questions:

2.  **Document which question you answered (link to your answer).**

[Question I
answered](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68276148/how-do-i-import-my-qz-files-from-illumina-sequencing-into-qiime2-via-a-manifest/70841244#70841244)

3.  **Relate your experience of answering the question to your reading.
    **

I first answered a question on stackoverflow and then read those reading
materials. I was surprised that the question I answered was somehow an
example of “good questions”. First of all, the title of the question
contains the software (qiime 2, a software that analyzes sequencing
data) he used and explained the issue clearly. That’s why I was able to
see his question quickly after I signed up on stackoverflow. His
question doesn’t contain any minimal, reproducible example since it’s
not needed for his question, but he did included examples of his data
files to show the data type. With those information, I was able to
understand his question and tried to answer it. From this homework, I
have learned that the title of the question should be clear and better
contain the language or software name to let people who have experience
with that language/software to have large probability to see the
question. Also, a minimal, reproducible example is always welcomed when
asking quesitons online.
