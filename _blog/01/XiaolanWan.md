## Prompt:

Asking good questions is a valuable skill to have - asking questions in an online setting is both easier and harder than asking questions in person: we can prepare to ask a question but we are also expected to prepare.
The links posted here give some advice on how to ask good questions:

- stackoverflow's [Asking a good question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)

- R's [Posting guidelines](https://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html)

- [minimal complete verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve), [minimal reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/)

Follow these links and read through the advice given, then

1. **Pick at least one question from stackoverflow or the R help and answer it.**

Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

2. **Document which question you answered (link to your answer).**

3. **Relate your experience of answering the question to your reading. **

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70816733/how-to-multiply-these-matrices


This person asked how to multiply the Matrices. He needs to multiple a matrix that is a 4x4 and a 4x3, but he didn't how to do it in R. I suggest him to use the function `%*%` to do the mulpication, and give him an example how to do this. This is my first time to answer other's questions on Stackoverflow. The website is very convenient to post my answer because I can insert my code there and it will automatically generate a clean code block. Thus, I can include my code to allow others to reproduce the results. Besides, I can create an example to better illustrate the question.
